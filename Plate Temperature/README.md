# Plate Temperature


Find the temperature distribution U on the plate in the XOY plane for given initial and boundary conditions in the time interval [0, T], where T is the time for establishing the stationary temperature distribution in the rod with a given accuracy. At the initial time, the plate is heated uniformly. 

Plate dimensions: d = 2.5 cu on the Ox axis and H = 1.3 cu Oy axis.
